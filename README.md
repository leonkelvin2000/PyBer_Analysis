# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview of the analysis:
- The purprose of the new analysis is to summarize how the data differs by city type and how those difference can be used decision-makers at PyBer.
- The timeframe we are using is from January 1, 2019 to April 28, 2019 for this data anaylsis.
- The city types we are using is Rural, Urban and Suburban.

## Results: 
- Rural Cities have the lower total of rides, drivers and fares but Average Fare per Ride and Average Fare per Driver is higher by estimated $4.00 due to demand that it is not as accessable in Rural areas.
- Urban cities have the highest total of rides, drivers and fare but Average Fare per Ride an Average Fare per Driver is lower due to it being more common to have in the city. 
- Suburban cities are in the median for all the data list - this shows that Suburbans cities have the best of both worlds where the ride prices are not expensive as Rural cities and not as cheap at Urban cities.

## Summary:
- In conclusion we can effectively say that a rural area will command a higher fare because there are fewer workers that will come to this area, the travel time and distance is most likely longer making the average fare per ride and driver the most out of all city types.

## Recommendations:
- Driver can be given incentives to work in rural cities to increase the demand in those cities.
- Charge per minute in Urban cities due to the mins per mile being completely different in urban cities compare to rural areas. 
- Charge a percentage decrease on fare during peak time to have more riders be willing to take the trips.
